The python files 'communication_broker.py' and 'socketclient.py' work with
Python 2.7 (though they may work with Python 3.x).

'socketclient.py' is a client script to set the server.

Testing:
--------
- Open three separate terminals (or Command Prompt windows)
- Run 'communication_broker.py' in one window
- Run 'socketclient.py' in the two other windows
- Follow the prompt in 'socketclient.py' and see how the server behaves
